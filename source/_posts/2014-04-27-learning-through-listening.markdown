Learning through listening
-----------------------

When encountering people who want to learn a language I often find them saying "I have to speak a language in order to learn it".

While that is definitely true, I find the power of **listening to a language** you just started learning in class is often underestimated.

What defines good language learning ? For me the highest sign that you have "made it" is when you are able to make jokes in another language.
When you are able to make jokes that means you did not only learn vocab and syntax and grammer but you started "owning" the language and appropriating it for your very specific own situation and more importantly you mastered human interaction and made this world a better place.

Let's see what you can do to get all of us cracking up and smiling. Here the five superpowers of listening:

1) Pronounciation, Intonation, Punctuation
Ok I think this one is obvious, will not spend more time elaborating on it. Think the new language might use vowels you are not used to expressing yourself or hearing the difference between them. Passive Listening is important.

2) Recognize
Once you have been listening passively without much energy you will notice how here and there you can understand a word or that someone is using past tense third person singular active.
When learning a language the first step is always to be able to recognize a) actually people using that language and b) them using the words and tenses you learned in class.

3) Focus
Accept that you cannot learn everything right away and just focus on learning the words and phrases repeatedly used over and over. To save your energy you need to be able open and close your brain and ears as necessary and most useful for your language learning

4) Observe
What will really makes you a native speaker if you start using the language like a native speaker would do. What would a native speaker say or do in this or that situation. That is a better approach then trying to 'translate' what you would normally do or say; that is exactly what makes you sound like a foreigner even if your grammer is perfectly fine.
