I first was introduced to Ruby on Rails with [@railsgirls_bln][id1] in 2012 and joined a weekly project group called [@rubymonster][id2] hosted by [Travis CI][id3].

[OpenTechSchool Berlin][id4] provided a great forum to present first results and learnings, read [here][id9].

Winter 2012/13 I joined [Launch Academy][id5]
